```
package main

  

import (

"math/rand"

"time"

  

"github.com/fatih/color"

)

  

const NumberOfPizzas = 10

  

var pizzasMade, pizzasFail, total int

  

type Producer struct {

data chan PizzaOrder

quit chan chan error

}

  

type PizzaOrder struct {

pizzaNumber int

message string

success bool

}

  

func pizzeria(pizzaMaker *Producer) {

//keep track of which pizza we're making

  

//run forever until we recieve a quit notification

  

//try to make pizzas

}

  

func main() {

//Seed the random number generator

rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

//rand.Seed via now is generated by default

  

//print out a message that program has started

color.Cyan("The Pizzeria is open for business")

color.Cyan("---------------------------------")

  

//create a producer

pizzaJob := &Producer{

data: make(chan PizzaOrder),

quit: make(chan chan error),

}

  

//run the producer in the background

  

go pizzeria(pizzaJob)

  

//create and run consumer

  

//Will print out the ending message

  

}
```

So, in the above example, func pizzeria is running in the background.

So, that means we've got to have a for loop.

Now, the only thing that our func pizzeria knows 
is the :
channel data -> get orders
channel quit -> tell pizzeria to quit.

Now, trying to make pizza's.

Now prior to this, we need to check if we made the pizza successfully.

The [[8.1.1 select statement]]

Now our base goroutine func looks like this : 

```
func pizzeria(pizzaMaker *Producer) {

//keep track of which pizza we're making

  

//run forever until we recieve a quit notification

  

//try to make pizzas

  

for {

//try to make a pizza

  

//decision

}

}
```

GOLDEN RULE : 
Whenever we're done with a channel, we need to close a chan.

The complete producer.

```
func makePizza(pizzaNumber int) *PizzaOrder {

pizzaNumber++

  

if pizzaNumber <= NumberOfPizzas {

delay := rand.Intn(5) + 1

fmt.Printf("Recieved order #%d!\n", pizzaNumber)

  

rnd := rand.Intn(12) + 1

msg := ""

success := false

  

if rnd < 5 {

pizzasFail++

} else {

pizzasMade++

}

total++

  

fmt.Printf("Making pizza #%d, it will take %d seconds\n", pizzaNumber, delay)

time.Sleep(time.Duration(delay) * time.Second)

  

if rnd <= 2 {

msg = fmt.Sprint("*** We ran out of ingredients for pizza #%d", pizzaNumber)

} else if rnd <= 4 {

msg = fmt.Sprint("The cook took an early day leave for pizza #%d", pizzaNumber)

} else {

success = true

msg = fmt.Sprintf("The pizza order #%d is ready", pizzaNumber)

}

  

p := PizzaOrder{

pizzaNumber: pizzaNumber,

message: msg,

success: success,

}

  

return &p

  

}

  

return &PizzaOrder{

pizzaNumber: pizzaNumber,

}

}

  

func pizzeria(pizzaMaker *Producer) {

var i = 0

//keep track of which pizza we're making

  

//run forever until we recieve a quit notification

  

//try to make pizzas

  

for {

currentPizza := makePizza(i)

//try to make a pizza

  

if currentPizza != nil {

i = currentPizza.pizzaNumber

select {

//we tried to make a pizza -> we sent something to the data channel

case pizzaMaker.data <- *currentPizza:

  

case quitChan := <-pizzaMaker.quit:

//close the channel

close(pizzaMaker.data)

close(quitChan)

return

}

  

//decision

}

}

}
```

The commands are sent via these channels

Note that function signature of pizzeria(producer *maker){}

pizzeria

data -> This is sent whenever we want to order a pizza.

quitChan -> Whenever the main function want's us to quit. 
Else go on a forever loop.
