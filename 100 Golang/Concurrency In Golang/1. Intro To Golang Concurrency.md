Go's philosophy of concurrency : 

1. So Go doesn't communicate by sharing memory, they share memory via communicating
2. So, whenever we want to communcate towards something, we fire a go command that will fire something into the background, how will you 
3. We can use primitives, something like the sync package, sync group and channels
4. Don't overkill things by using shared memory and complicated, error-prone synchronization primitives; instead use message passing between GoRoutines so variables and data can be used in the appropriate sequence.
5. We'll start by looking at the basic types of sync package : [[5. Mutexes]]  (semaphores) and [[2. waitgroups]].
6. The [[8. producer-Consumer problem]] , [[9. dining philosopher]] and the [[sleeping-barber]].
