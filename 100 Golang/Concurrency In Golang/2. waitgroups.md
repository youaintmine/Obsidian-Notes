```
package main
import "fmt"
func main() {

fmt.Println("Hello World")

}
```

Now, can you see the main function in here. it itself is one go-routine.

A program can have one but it can have two as well.

A go-routine is a very lightweight thread. They're all managed via a simple 

Now, see this code. 

```
func printSomething(s string) {

fmt.Println(s)

}

  

func main() {

fmt.Println("Hello World")

  

go printSomething("First thing")

  

printSomething("Second thing")

}
```

Print : 

```
Hello World
Second thing
```

So, it happened so fast that the first thing command didn't have time to print its value.

```
func main() {

fmt.Println("Hello World")

  

words := []string{

"alpha",

"beta",

"gamma",

"pi",

"theta",

"epsilon",

"zeta",

"eta",

"peta",

"meta",

}

  

for i, x := range words {

go printSomething(fmt.Sprintf("%d: %s", i, x))

}

time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

printSomething("Second thing")

}
```

This won't yield us the correct results.

Now the solution is wg.

Waitgroups are the easiest.

The first thing I want to have, is one entry for everything that I need to wait for.

Take the previous example let's say.

wg.add(10)

Since, there are 10 calls that I have to account for.

```
package main
import (
"fmt"
"sync"
) 

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {

fmt.Println(s)

}

  

func main() {

  

var wg sync.WaitGroup

  

words := []string{

"alpha",

"beta",

"gamma",

"pi",

"theta",

"epsilon",

"zeta",

"eta",

"peta",

"meta",

}

  

wg.Add(10)

  

for i, x := range words {

go printSomething(fmt.Sprintf("%d: %s", i, x), &wg)

}

  

wg.Wait()

  

printSomething("Second thing")

}
```

Now, we need to pass in the waitGroup as pointers and not as values. Because, we wouldn't want them to cause any trouble to the value

```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"sync"

)

  

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {

defer wg.Done()

fmt.Println(s)

}

  

func main() {

  

var wg sync.WaitGroup

  

words := []string{

"alpha",

"beta",

"gamma",

"pi",

"theta",

"epsilon",

"zeta",

"eta",

"peta",

"meta",

}

  

wg.Add(len(words) + 1)

  

for i, x := range words {

go printSomething(fmt.Sprintf("%d: %s", i, x), &wg)

}

  

wg.Wait()

  

printSomething("Second thing", &wg)

}
```

Now the above will cause deadlock, because, see we're using 10 wg when there are only len go routines that we're expecting the result from.

This will be correct in this form . 
```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"sync"

)

  

func printSomething(s string, wg *sync.WaitGroup) {

defer wg.Done()

fmt.Println(s)

}

  

func main() {

  

var wg sync.WaitGroup

  

words := []string{

"alpha",

"beta",

"gamma",

"pi",

"theta",

"epsilon",

"zeta",

"eta",

"peta",

"meta",

}

  

wg.Add(len(words))

  

for i, x := range words {

go printSomething(fmt.Sprintf("%d: %s", i, x), &wg)

}

  

wg.Wait()

wg.Add(1)

  

printSomething("Second thing", &wg)

}
```
