Please note the step of the problem

1. Seed a random number generator
2. Print the message that program has started.
3. Create a producer
4. Run the producer in the background
5. Create and run consumer
6. We'll print out the ending message
   
[[7.  channels]] are far more powerful then mutexes.

[[7.  channels]] are able to talk to each other.

```
type Producer struct {

data chan pizzaOrder

data chan chan error

}
```

```
type PizzaOrder struct {

pizzaNumber int

message string

success bool

}
```

Why do we have 
a 
chan chan
