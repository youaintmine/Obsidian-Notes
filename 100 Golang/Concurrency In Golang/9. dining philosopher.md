The problem statement.

1. A classic by djikstra in 1965
2. 5 philosophers in a house together, they always dine together at the same table, sitting in the same place.
3. They eat spaghetti with two forks.
4. However there are two forks next to each plate. It means that no two neighnours can eat at the same time.

```package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"sync"

"time"

)

  

const hunger = 3

  

var philosophers = []string{"Aristotle", "Plato", "Archimedes", "Aurelius", "Pascal"}

var wg sync.WaitGroup

var sleeptime = 1 * time.Second

var eatTime = 2 * time.Second

var thinkTime = 2 * time.Second

var orderMutex = &sync.Mutex{}

  

func dining(curr_philosopher int, orderOfFinising *[]string, leftFork, rightFork *sync.Mutex) {

defer wg.Done()

  

fmt.Printf("\t%s has become seated\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

time.Sleep(sleeptime)

  

for i := 0; i < hunger; i++ {

  

fmt.Printf("\t%s has become hungry\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

time.Sleep(sleeptime)

  

//lock both forks

leftFork.Lock()

fmt.Printf("\t%s picked up the fork to his left\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

  

rightFork.Lock()

fmt.Printf("\t%s picked up the fork to his right\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

  

fmt.Printf("\t%s is eating\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

time.Sleep(eatTime)

  

time.Sleep(thinkTime)

fmt.Printf("\t%s is thinking\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

//unlock the forks

rightFork.Unlock()

fmt.Printf("\t%s put down fork on his right\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

leftFork.Unlock()

fmt.Printf("\t%s put down fork on his left\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

time.Sleep(sleeptime)

}

  

fmt.Printf("\t%s has finished eating\n", philosophers[curr_philosopher])

orderMutex.Lock()

*orderOfFinising = append(*orderOfFinising, philosophers[curr_philosopher])

orderMutex.Unlock()

  

}

  

func main() {

//We'll have different sets of philosophers

  

//print the program started

fmt.Println("\tThe Philosophers Program has started")

fmt.Println("---------------------------------------------")

  

//These philosopher's will lock the spoon next to them. i.e if a philosopher want's to eat something, then his neighbouring

// philosopher will not be able to eat.

  

//Now we'll need to add a waitGroup for our philosphers to start eating.

wg.Add(len(philosophers))

  

//For each philosopher, there'll be one go-routine.

  

orderOfFinising := make([]string, 0)

forkLeft := &sync.Mutex{}

for i := 0; i < len(philosophers); i++ {

//Inside this for loop.

// We'll generate two mutexes, one for the rightHand and one for the leftHand

// We'll pass the rightHand and leftHand to the dining function

// We'll also pass the index of the philosopher

forkRight := &sync.Mutex{}

  

go dining(i, &orderOfFinising, forkRight, forkLeft)

  

//Now prior to this, we need the forkRight to be the forkLeft for the next philosopher.

//So we'll assign the forkRight to the forkLeft of the next philosopher.

forkLeft = forkRight

}

  

wg.Wait()

  

fmt.Println("---------------------------------------------")

fmt.Println("\tThe Philosophers Program has ended")

fmt.Printf("\tThe order of finishing is: %v\n", orderOfFinising)

}
```

Now, in the orderOfEating was given as a challenge


If i didn't use a mutex. Then it means, that our thing is sort of defeated.

Like there will be race conditions.

==================


So, use this 

orderMutex.Lock()

*orderOfFinising = append(*orderOfFinising, philosophers[curr_philosopher])
orderMutex.Unlock()

So, I've got 5 different versions of goroutine in this.

And I've got them running differently.

Now, at some point they're all accessing the 
orderOfFinishing.

So, we need thread-safe code here.
As there might be that two go-routines
Are into the same function at different point of times.

Now writing the test file.

We might miss a golden race condition.


In this test file.

if len(orderOfFinishing) != 5 {

```
t.Errorf("Expected 5 philosophers to finish eating, got %d", len(orderOfFinishing))

}
```


If instead I run the main file for a 1000 times.
Then it will fail. (Provided, we've removed the race handling conditon)
