It allows us to deal with race conditions

dealing with shared resources, parallel and concurrent goroutines.

Lock/Unlock

We can test for race conditions when running code or testing it.

 Now, continuing from [[4. Races]]
We will add the sync.Mutex to our first piece of code.

```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"sync"

)

  

var msg string

var wg sync.WaitGroup

  

func updateMessage(s string, m *sync.Mutex) {

defer wg.Done()

m.Lock()

msg = s

m.Unlock()

}

  

func main() {

msg = "Hello, world!"

wg.Add(2)

  

var mutex sync.Mutex

go updateMessage("Hello, universe!", &mutex)

go updateMessage("Hello, cosmos!", &mutex)

wg.Wait()

fmt.Println(msg)

}
```

This is what is called a thread-safe.



Now write a test for mutexes : [[6. Test Mutexes]]


After this we find a new example 

```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"sync"

)

  

var wg sync.WaitGroup

  

type Income struct {

Source string

Amount int

}

  

func main() {

//How much money is someone going to make in 52 Weeks

  

//define starting bank balance

var bankBalance int

  

//print out the starting values

fmt.Printf("Initial account balance: %d.00", bankBalance)

  

//define weekly revenue

incomes := []Income{

{Source: "Main Job", Amount: 500},

{Source: "Gifts", Amount: 10},

{Source: "Part Time", Amount: 50},

{Source: "Investments", Amount: 100},

}

  

wg.Add(len(incomes))

  

//loop through 52 weeks and print out how much is made,

//keep a running cost.

  

for i, income := range incomes {

  

go func(i int, income Income) {

defer wg.Done()

for week := 1; week <= 52; week++ {

temp := bankBalance

temp += income.Amount

bankBalance = temp

  

fmt.Printf("On week %d you earned %d.00 from %s", week, bankBalance, income.Source)

}

}(i, income)

}

  

//print out the final balance

wg.Wait()

  

fmt.Printf("Final Bank Balance: %d.00", bankBalance)

fmt.Println()

}
```

So, the problem with this code, is it's not thread-safe.

Inconsistent overlap of access of "bankBalance"

```
var balance sync.Mutex
```

We've added. this.

And lock and unlock

```
balance.Lock()

temp := bankBalance

temp += income.Amount

bankBalance = temp

balance.Unlock()
```

	But please note that, getting in a particular order is not possible with this. 

Also, Note that we need mutexes. And waitGroups as well.
Please note that waitGroups only waits our functions before continuing ahead form a point.


Also, please note that mutexes only solves the thread-safety. 
In this example, the order of instructions we're doing doesn't matter.

However if the example was let's say, the interest rate or our balance increase / changes depending on our previous, balance.

Then we won't be able to solve this.
