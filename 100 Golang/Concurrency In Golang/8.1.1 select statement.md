It allows us to determine, 
what action to take based upon the type of result
that we get from goroutine.


Now, in the previous sleeping-barber example.

If I comment out go-routine. Then what will happen is, 
We'll get a deadlock, because, 
Without anything in the ping channel, we're trying to get updates.

```
-> er
fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!

goroutine 1 [chan send]:
main.main()
        /Users/baarish/Projects-Personal/go-concurrency/chapter-1/sleeping-barbara-problem/main.go:35 +0x54
exit status 2
```


The functionality of OK
```
func shout(ping <-chan string, pong chan<- string) {
for {
s, ok := <-ping

if !ok {
//Do something
}
pong <- fmt.Sprintf("%s!!!", strings.ToUpper(s))
}
}
```


This, ok will send us two values, 

true something was sent in the channel
False nothing, 0 or the channel was closed.


Now comes the lesson

We have two server functions or rather go routines.

```
func serv1(ch chan string) {

for {

time.Sleep(6 * time.Second)

ch <- "This is from server1"

}

}

  

func serv2(ch chan string) {

for {

time.Sleep(3 * time.Second)

ch <- "This is from server2"

}

}
```

```
for {

select {

case s1 := <-channel1:

fmt.Println("Case One", s1)

case s2 := <-channel1:

fmt.Println("Case Two", s2)

case s3 := <-channel2:

fmt.Println("Case Three", s3)

case s4 := <-channel2:

fmt.Println("Case Four", s4)

default:

//avoiding deadlock

}
```

If we have multiple cases similar.

And also, default case handles, avoiding deadlock situations.

Now comes [[7. 1 buffered channels]].
