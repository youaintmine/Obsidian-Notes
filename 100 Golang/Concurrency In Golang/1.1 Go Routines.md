Runs in the background or concurrently

Very easy to use.

e.g go func

[[2. waitgroups]] are the easiest to work with

So, waitgroups lets us await for the go routines to get completed.
But, it doesn't solve thread-safety environment.
See the examples [[2. waitgroups]] and also the testing of these waitgroups
[[3. tests in waitgroups]]

This, is where [[5. Mutexes]] come in.
[[5. Mutexes]] help us create a thread-safe environment.
See the example of [[6. Test Mutexes]]
