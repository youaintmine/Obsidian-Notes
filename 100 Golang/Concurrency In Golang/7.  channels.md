Channels are means of having GoRoutines share data

They can talk to each other.

This is Go's philosophy of sharing memory via communication rather, than communicating via sharing memory.

The producer/consumer problem.

One can have uni/bi - directional.

See the example of Producer - Consumer.

Creating a channel: 

make(chan PizaaOrder)
make(chan chan error)

Now, why did we create two channels

```
pizzaJob := &Producer{

data: make(chan PizzaOrder),

quit: make(chan chan error),

}
```

Well, this is a way of communicating b/w threads
when one data is sort of completed.
We need to use the quit channel. 
To give us the message.

The initial setup

Creating the [[8.1 producer]]

After this We're going to create the producer.

Now the next step is to create the[[8.2 consumer]].


Also look at [[10. Sleeping-Barber-Problem]]


Now : 

1. Once we fire a goroutine no way of communicating besides channels
2. Channels can be bufferd or unbuffered,
where they can accept more than one thing.
Eg. if you have a channel that can take 10 channels.

3. Now golden rules, once you open, you need to close the channel
4. A channel can have given structs.
