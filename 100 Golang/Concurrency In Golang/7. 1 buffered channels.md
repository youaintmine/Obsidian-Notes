```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"time"

)

  

func listenToChan(ch chan int) {

for {

//print a got data message.

i := <-ch

fmt.Println("Got", i, " from channel")

  

time.Sleep(1 * time.Second)

}

}

  

func main() {

ch := make(chan int)

  

go listenToChan(ch)

  

for i := 0; i < 100; i++ {

fmt.Println("Sending", i, " to channel...")

ch <- i

fmt.Println("sent", i, " to channel...")

}

  

fmt.Println("Completed")

close(ch)

}
```

Initial Setup :

```
sent 0  to channel...
Sending 1  to channel...
Got 0  from channel
sent 1  to channel...
Sending 2  to channel...
Got 1  from channel
Got 2  from channel
sent 2  to channel...
Sending 3  to channel...
Got 3  from channel
sent 3  to channel...
Sending 4  to channel...
Got 4  from channel
sent 4  to channel...
Sending 5  to channel...
```

As you realise that the goroutine is a blocking one in the background.

So, what will happen is it will run in synchronously.

Because, channels are not threading.

But let's run the program for fixed size of 10.
Then

```
Sending 0  to channel...
sent 0  to channel...
Sending 1  to channel...
sent 1  to channel...
Sending 2  to channel...
sent 2  to channel...
Sending 3  to channel...
sent 3  to channel...
Sending 4  to channel...
sent 4  to channel...
Sending 5  to channel...
sent 5  to channel...
Sending 6  to channel...
sent 6  to channel...
Sending 7  to channel...
sent 7  to channel...
Sending 8  to channel...
sent 8  to channel...
Sending 9  to channel...
sent 9  to channel...
Sending 10  to channel...
sent 10  to channel...
Sending 11  to channel...
Got 0  from channel
Got 1  from channel
sent 11  to channel...
Sending 12  to channel...
Got 2  from channel
sent 12  to channel...
Sending 13  to channel...
Got 3  from channel
sent 13  to channel...
Sending 14  to channel...
Got 4  from channel
sent 14  to channel...
Sending 15  to channel...
Got 5  from channel
sent 15  to channel...
```

Now its pulling 10 things from the channel.

The first 10 went pretty useful.

They are useful 

1. When we know how many go routines we've launched
2. Or limit goroutines that we want to launch
3. Limit the amount of og -routines.

Back to the OG Sleeping-Barber Problem : 


The BarberShop : 

```
package main
import (
"time"
"github.com/fatih/color"

)
type BarberShop struct {
shopCapacity int
hairCutDuration time.Duration
numberOfBarbers int
  

BarbersDoneChan chan bool
ClientsChan chan string
open bool}

  
func (shop *BarberShop) addBarber(barber string) {
shop.numberOfBarbers++

go func() {
isSleeping := false
color.Yellow("%s goes to the waiting room to check for clients.", barber)

for {
//If there are no clients, the barber goes to sleep.

if len(shop.ClientsChan) == 0 {

color.Yellow("There is nothing to do, so %s is taking a nap", barber)

isSleeping = true
}
client := <- shop.ClientsChan


}

  

}()

}
```

The above func is not complete.

for {

//If there are no clients, the barber goes to sleep.

if len(shop.ClientsChan) == 0 {

color.Yellow("There is nothing to do, so %s is taking a nap", barber)

isSleeping = true

}

  

client := <- shop.ClientsChan

}

Now, in this do you see. 

In this for loop, we're constantly listening to the client or the waiting room.

If anyone comes, now before we take on a customer we need to check if the shop is OPEN or CLOSED.

Now, I can easily check this via "Open"

But, this might be the cause of race conditions.

As this is in a go-routine.

client,shopOpen := <- shop.ClientsChan

We'll be taking advantage of that.

```
package main

  

import (

"time"

  

"github.com/fatih/color"

)

  

type BarberShop struct {

shopCapacity int

hairCutDuration time.Duration

numberOfBarbers int

  

BarbersDoneChan chan bool

ClientsChan chan string

  

open bool

}

  

func (shop *BarberShop) addBarber(barber string) {

shop.numberOfBarbers++

  

go func() {

isSleeping := false

color.Yellow("%s goes to the waiting room to check for clients.", barber)

  

for {

//If there are no clients, the barber goes to sleep.

if len(shop.ClientsChan) == 0 {

color.Yellow("There is nothing to do, so %s is taking a nap", barber)

isSleeping = true

}

  

client, shopOpen := <-shop.ClientsChan

  

if shopOpen {

if isSleeping {

color.Yellow("%s is wakes %s up", client, barber)

isSleeping = false

}

//cutHair

shop.cutHair(barber, client)

} else {

//Shop is closed, send the barber home.

//Close the goroutine.

shop.sendBarberHome(barber)

return

}

}

  

}()

  

}

  

func (shop *BarberShop) cutHair(barber, client string) {

color.Green("%s is cutting %s's hair", barber, client)

time.Sleep(shop.hairCutDuration)

color.Green("%s has finished cutting %s's hair", barber, client)

}

  

func (shop *BarberShop) sendBarberHome(barber string) {

color.Cyan("%s is going home as shoped has closed for the day", barber)

//Send a boolean to the shop.BarberCha

shop.BarbersDoneChan <- true

}
```

We've written another function that, looks at closeShopForDay(): 

```
func (shop *BarberShop) closeShopForDay() {

color.Yellow("Shop is getting Closed for the day")

  
close(shop.ClientsChan)
shop.open = false

for a := 1; a <= shop.numberOfBarbers; a++ {
<-shop.BarbersDoneChan
}

close(shop.BarbersDoneChan)

color.Green("The barber shop is now closed")

}

```

Now, this function what does it do : 

1. close.ClientsChan because, we no more want to listen to clientsChan
2. For all the available barbers who still has some customers once they complete. Their last cutting. we'll wait for them
3. close. BarbersDoneChan

Now, what does the main func looks like.

```
func main() {

  

//print the welcome message

color.Yellow("The sleeping barber problem")

color.Yellow("-----------------------------")

  

//Create channels if we need any

clientChan := make(chan string, seatingCapacity)

doneChan := make(chan bool)

  

//create the salon

shop := BarberShop{

shopCapacity: seatingCapacity,

hairCutDuration: cutDuration,

numberOfBarbers: 0,

ClientsChan: clientChan,

BarbersDoneChan: doneChan,

open: true,

}

  

color.Green("The Shop is open for the day")

  

//add barbers

shop.addBarber("Frank")

  

//We're going to make each of the barbers as their own routine.

  

//start the barberShop as a goroutine.

  

shopClosing := make(chan bool)

closed := make(chan bool)

  

go func() {

<-time.After(timeOpen)

shopClosing <- true

shop.closeShopForDay()

closed <- true

}()

  

//add clients

  

//block until barbershop is closed

  

time.Sleep(5 * time.Second)

}
```

Look at this piece of code : 

go func() {
<-time.After(timeOpen)
shopClosing <- true
shop.closeShopForDay()
closed <- true
}()

Looks its a goroutine, that gets triggered after timeOpen. 

And before that we're trying to do all the barber cutting things.

Now, why time.After(timeOpen)

didn't wait for 10 seconds.


Adding the CLIENTS : 

```
func (shop *BarberShop) addClient(client string) {

color.Green("*** %s arrived at salon", client)

  

if shop.open {

select {

case <-shop.ClientsChan:

color.Blue("%s takes a seat in the waiting room")

default:

color.Red("The waiting room is full")

}

} else {

color.Red("The shop is already closed so %s leaves", client)

}

}
```

We're handling the clients trough select statements

```
package main

  

import (

"fmt"

"math/rand"

"time"

  

"github.com/fatih/color"

)

  

var seatingCapacity = 10

var arrivalRate = 100

var cutDuration = 1000 * time.Millisecond

var timeOpen = 10 * time.Second

  

func main() {

  

//print the welcome message

color.Yellow("The sleeping barber problem")

color.Yellow("-----------------------------")

  

//Create channels if we need any

clientChan := make(chan string, seatingCapacity)

doneChan := make(chan bool)

  

//create the salon

shop := BarberShop{

shopCapacity: seatingCapacity,

hairCutDuration: cutDuration,

numberOfBarbers: 0,

ClientsChan: clientChan,

BarbersDoneChan: doneChan,

open: true,

}

  

color.Green("The Shop is open for the day")

  

//add barbers

shop.addBarber("Frank")

  

//We're going to make each of the barbers as their own routine.

  

//start the barberShop as a goroutine.

  

shopClosing := make(chan bool)

closed := make(chan bool)

  

go func() {

<-time.After(timeOpen)

shopClosing <- true

shop.closeShopForDay()

closed <- true

}()

  

//add clients

  

i := 1

  

go func() {

for {

// get random number

randomMillSecs := rand.Int() % (2 * arrivalRate)

select {

case <-shopClosing:

return

case <-time.After(time.Millisecond * time.Duration(randomMillSecs)):

shop.addClient(fmt.Sprintf("Client #%d", i))

i++

}

}

}()

  

//block until barbershop is closed

<-closed

}
```

The knowledge graph goes like :
